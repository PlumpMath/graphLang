Section 2.2.4 of SICP presents a simple language for drawing pictures that illustrates the power of data abstraction and closure, and also exploits higher-order procedures in an essential way. Try to implement it in Python.

The picture language is based on the language Peter Henderson created to construct images like M.C. Escher's "Square Limit" woodcut.
